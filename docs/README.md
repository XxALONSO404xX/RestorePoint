⚙️ Prerequisites
Before using RestorePoint, ensure your system has the following tools:


sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y \
  borgbackup \
  age \
  rclone \
  curl \
  make \
  docker.io docker-compose
If Docker is not supported in your environment, you can install Prometheus & Grafana natively.

🚀 Quickstart
1. Clone the Project
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/RestorePoint.git
cd RestorePoint
2. Setup Age Encryption Keys
Generate private and public keys for encryption:

age-keygen -o config/age/private.key
cat config/age/private.key | grep "public key" | awk '{print $NF}' > config/age/public.key
3. Setup Rclone with Google Drive
Configure Rclone to sync with Google Drive:

rclone config
# Create a remote called "Gdrive" with Google Drive access
Then, copy your rclone configuration:


cp ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf config/rclone/rclone.conf
4. Initialize Borg Repository
Initialize the Borg repository with encryption:


borg init --encryption=repokey backups/local/borg-repo
📦 Usage
🔁 Create a Backup
Create a backup either locally or encrypted with Google Drive:


make backup
You'll choose between a local-only backup or an encrypted one with upload to Google Drive.

♻️ Restore a Backup
Restore from a local Borg archive or from a remote encrypted backup:


make restore
💾 Save Configs/State
Backup all config files (including rclone, age, and prometheus) and upload them:


make save
📊 Launch Monitoring Dashboard
Launch Prometheus and Grafana (if using Docker or native installation):


make monitor
Prometheus: http://localhost:9090

Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (Username: admin, Password: admin)

Import Dashboard ID 1860 for full system metrics.

📂 View Logs
Access the logs generated by the scripts:


make logs
🔁 Automate Backups with Cron
Add these cron jobs to automate backups and state-saving:


crontab -e
Add the following to schedule backup and saving tasks:


0 2 * * * bash /home/youruser/RestorePoint/scripts/backup.sh >> /home/youruser/RestorePoint/logs/cron-backup.log 2>&1
0 3 * * 1 bash /home/youruser/RestorePoint/scripts/saving.sh >> /home/youruser/RestorePoint/logs/cron-save.log 2>&1

🧪 Tested On
RestorePoint has been tested on the following systems:

Ubuntu 20.04 / 22.04

Debian 11+

VirtualBox + WSL2

🔐 Security Notes
Age encryption keys are stored locally. Do not commit private.key to Git.

.gitignore is pre-configured to skip sensitive files.

For production, consider implementing remote backup key rotation and secrets management.
